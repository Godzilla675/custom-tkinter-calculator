# Calculator Fix Summary

## Problem Statement
Fix the calculator - half the stuff doesn't work such as the graphing and function solving. Also add a feature that solves x and y and the variables in the equation AND TEST ALL THE FEATURES.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Graphing Issues
- **Security Issue**: Used unsafe `eval()` for function evaluation
- **Bug**: String replacement broke inverse trig functions
  - Replacing "sin" with "np.sin" also affected "asin" → "anp.sin"
  - Same issue with "cos"/"acos" and "tan"/"atan"
- **Missing**: No error display for graphing failures

### 2. Equation Solver Limitations
- **Limited**: Only solved for variable 'x'
- **Missing**: No support for multi-variable equations (y, z, etc.)
- **Missing**: No automatic variable detection

### 3. Expression Operations
- **Limited**: Differentiation only worked with x
- **Limited**: Integration only worked with x
- **Missing**: No partial derivatives for multi-variable expressions

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Graphing (calculator.py lines 1090-1165)
**Changes:**
- Replaced unsafe `eval()` with SymPy's `lambdify()` for safe evaluation
- Removed problematic string replacements
- Use SymPy's symbolic parser (`sympify`) to parse functions correctly
- Added error display label to show graphing errors
- Now supports all functions: sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, exp, log, sqrt, etc.

**Before:**
```python
func_str = func_str.replace('sin', 'np.sin')  # Breaks asin!
y = eval(func_str)  # Unsafe!
```

**After:**
```python
expr = sp.sympify(func_str_clean)
func = sp.lambdify(x, expr, modules=['numpy'])
y_vals = func(x_vals)
```

### 2. Multi-Variable Equation Solver (calculator.py lines 1173-1251)
**Changes:**
- Automatic variable detection using `equation.free_symbols`
- Solve for each variable in multi-variable equations
- Display solutions for all variables
- Support for x, y, z, and any other variables

**Features:**
- Single variable: `x**2 - 4*x + 4 = 0` → solves for x
- Two variables: `x + 2*y = 10` → solves for x and y separately
- Three+ variables: `x + y + z = 15` → solves for each variable

### 3. Enhanced Expression Operations (calculator.py lines 1252-1310)
**Changes:**
- Differentiation: Automatic variable detection and partial derivatives
- Integration: Handle multiple variables independently
- Expand/Factor: Already worked with multiple variables, no changes needed

**Features:**
- Single variable: `d/dx(x**3) = 3*x**2`
- Multiple variables: `∂/∂x(x**2 + y**2) = 2*x` and `∂/∂y(x**2 + y**2) = 2*y`

### 4. UI Improvements (calculator.py lines 265-349)
**Changes:**
- Added error display label to graphing tab
- Increased control frame height to accommodate error display
- Errors now show in red text below the graphing controls

## Testing

### Test Suite Expansion
- **Original**: 30 tests in `test_enhanced_calculator.py`
- **New**: 16 tests in `test_new_features.py`
- **Total**: 46 comprehensive tests

### New Test Coverage
1. **Graphing Tests** (7 tests):
   - Basic functions (x**2, sin(x), exp(x), log(x))
   - Inverse trig functions (asin, acos, atan)
   - Multiple function plotting
   - Graph clearing

2. **Multi-Variable Solver Tests** (4 tests):
   - Two-variable equations (x + y = 10, 2*x + 3*y = 12)
   - Three-variable equations (x + y + z = 15)
   - Quadratic with multiple variables

3. **Multi-Variable Operations Tests** (5 tests):
   - Partial derivatives (x**2 + y**2, x*y + y*z + x*z)
   - Multi-variable integration
   - Expand/Factor multi-variable expressions

### Manual Testing
Created `manual_test.py` - comprehensive test script that programmatically tests:
- Basic calculator operations
- Scientific functions
- Graphing (all function types)
- Equation solver (single and multi-variable)
- Expression operations
- Matrix operations
- Unit conversions

**Result**: All features working correctly! ✅

### Test Results
```
test_enhanced_calculator.py: 30/30 PASSED
test_new_features.py: 16/16 PASSED
manual_test.py: ALL FEATURES WORKING
Total: 46/46 tests passing (100%)
```

## Security

### Code Review
- ✅ No issues found
- ✅ All code follows best practices

### CodeQL Security Scan
- ✅ 0 security alerts
- ✅ No vulnerabilities detected

### Security Improvements
1. **Removed eval()**: Eliminated unsafe code execution in graphing
2. **Safe evaluation**: All user input now goes through SymPy's symbolic parser
3. **AST parsing**: Calculator still uses AST for basic operations (already secure)
4. **No injection risks**: Cannot execute arbitrary code through graphing or equations

## Examples

### Graphing Examples
```python
# All these now work correctly:
sin(x)           # Basic trig
asin(x/10)       # Inverse trig (was broken before!)
cos(x) + sin(x)  # Combined functions
exp(x)           # Exponential
log(x+1)         # Logarithmic
x**2 + x         # Polynomial
```

### Multi-Variable Equation Examples
```python
# Two variables
x + y = 10
# Shows: x = 10 - y, y = 10 - x

2*x + 3*y = 12
# Shows: x = (12 - 3*y)/2, y = (12 - 2*x)/3

# Three variables
x + y + z = 15
# Shows solution for each: x, y, z

# Quadratic with multiple variables
x**2 + y = 5
# Shows: x = ±√(5 - y), y = 5 - x**2
```

### Differentiation Examples
```python
# Single variable
x**3
# Shows: f'(x) = 3*x**2

# Multiple variables (partial derivatives)
x**2 + y**2
# Shows: ∂f/∂x = 2*x, ∂f/∂y = 2*y

x*y + y*z + x*z
# Shows partial derivatives for x, y, and z
```
